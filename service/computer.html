                <p> like maintenance on your car, house or even your own body, routine computer maintenance 
                can provide tremendous benefits while saving time and money. 
                There are several maintenance tasks that are easy to do and can be managed by
                 anyone with basic computer knowledge.</p>

                <h3>Longer Computer Life</h3>
               <p> Plugging your computer into an electrical surge protector is something everyone
                 do to protect against changes in the electricity supply.
                  But, you also must test your surge protector regularly. 
                  The manufacturer of the surge protector provides instructions on
                   how to perform this test. If your surge protector is not adequately working,
                 your computer's motherboard or hard drive could be destroyed
                  from even the most minor electrical surge.
                   This simple test can prolong your computer's life by months or years,
                    and it only needs to be done about every six months or so and we provide this service in out computer
                    service plan</p>

                <h3>Reduced Likelihood of Lost Files</h3>
<p> up your computer files is a task that many people put off because it can be time intensive 
    or it may seem unnecessary. Unfortunately, if your computer crashes, you won't usually get 
    a second chance to recover your files and photos. Make back-ups a regular part of your routine.
     In addition to making your own backups with CDs or an external hard drive,      
       making file back-ups easy and safe. we make databackups so you would't have to go through the
    hassle.</p>

<h3>Faster Speed</h3>
<p> your hard drive, running spyware and virus removal programs as well as installing the
     latest drivers and software updates are all computer maintenance tasks
      that help keep your computer running at top speed. 
       Windows updates if you are running that system.
        Not only do these updates help your computer run more efficiently,
         but they help close any recent security holes.</p>

<h3>Protection Against Threats</h3>
<p>Keeping your spyware and anti-virus programs updated and running on a regular basis 
    is essential to keeping threats at bay. You may never realize you have any spyware 
    or viruses on your computer, but they could be there wrecking havoc in the background
     by stealing your personal information and transmitting it to third parties,
      destroying your files or even making your computer unusable.
       Most spyware and anti-virus programs can be set up on a schedule 
       so that they run automatically on your chosen day and time.</p>
